üü¢ Beginner Projects (Focus: Language Basics & Ownership)

    CLI Todo App

        Learn: Structs, enums, file I/O, ownership, CLI args.

        Use clap or structopt for parsing arguments.

        Why it helps: Solana programs don‚Äôt have GUIs ‚Äî CLI tools are very common for managing them.

    Simple Bank Ledger (in-memory)

        Learn: HashMaps, struct modeling, methods, basic error handling.

        Simulate deposits, withdrawals, and account balances.

        Why it helps: Prepares you to model account state like Solana smart contracts do.

    Guessing Game

        Based on the Rust Book.

        Learn: Match statements, error handling, user input.

üü° Intermediate Projects (Focus: Memory Management & Serialization)

    Key-Value Store (like Redis-lite)

        Learn: File-based storage, serde for serialization, traits.

        Optional: Add a simple networking layer (tokio).

        Why it helps: Solana contracts work with serialized data (Borsh, JSON), and you'll need to model state carefully.

    Mini Blockchain Simulator

        Build a block struct with hash, transactions, previous hash.

        Add basic proof-of-work (difficulty-based hashing).

        Learn: Hashing (sha2 or blake3), linked structs, data integrity.

        Why it helps: You simulate how blockchain state flows, relevant for understanding Solana‚Äôs architecture.

    Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe (via UDP or JSON API)

        Learn: Networking (tokio, serde_json, warp or actix).

        Optional: Store game state in a file or memory.

        Why it helps: Simulates client-server logic ‚Äî very useful for Solana off-chain programs.

üîµ Advanced Prep for Solana

    Account State Manager

        Model accounts like Solana does: a struct with an ID, balance, and arbitrary data (owned by a "program").

        Simulate instruction parsing and execution.

        Learn: Custom types, ownership + borrowing with references, serialization (borsh or serde).

        Why it helps: Mimics how Solana accounts and instructions are structured.

    Transaction Processor

        Create a simple ‚Äúprogram‚Äù that processes an instruction (e.g., transfer tokens between accounts).

        Use enums to define instruction types.

        Why it helps: Directly maps to Solana‚Äôs CPI (cross-program invocation) and instruction dispatching logic.

Tooling to Practice Alongside

    Cargo and Crates.io ‚Äì Learn how to manage dependencies and publish crates.

    Unit Testing ‚Äì Write tests for every module you create; Solana heavily depends on test-driven development.

    Linting & Formatting ‚Äì Use clippy and rustfmt early.
